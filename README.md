# 🧊 FrozenLake RL: SARSA vs Q-Learning

This project implements and compares two foundational reinforcement learning algorithms — **SARSA** (on-policy) and **Q-learning** (off-policy) — in OpenAI Gym's classic `FrozenLake-v1` environment. It's a hands-on exercise based on chapter 6 of *Sutton & Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Implement SARSA and Q-learning using tabular methods
- ✅ Explore the differences between on-policy and off-policy learning
- ✅ Train agents on both **deterministic** and **stochastic** versions of FrozenLake
- ✅ Analyze learning curves, convergence, and policy behavior

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning
- On-Policy vs Off-Policy control
- ε-Greedy exploration
- Tabular Q-value updates
- Environment stochasticity
